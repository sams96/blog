August 01 is Swiss national day, and one of the few days of the year that it's
legal to set off fireworks here in Zurich. I decided to head out in the evening
with my digital camera to see the fireworks and take a few photos, primarily
just for myself and maybe to put a few on my Instagram story (hence the vertial
compositions). In the end I thought I had a nice little atmospheric photo series
which would fit nicely here.
