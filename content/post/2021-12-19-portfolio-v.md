This year was, unlike the previous few, without any major travel. Although I did
move from the UK to Switzerland, which did give me a new place to explore and
photograph. Even with that I took a fraction of the number of photos I usually
take in a year in 2020, which left me with not much to choose from for this
selection. I chose to still put it together though because I like that this has
become somewhat of a yearly reflection (even if it does take me the better part
of the next year to put them together) and I thought that given it was somewhat
of an interesting year it could be nice to have this record.

Along with the reduced number of photos taken came a complete lack of work
towards any larger serious projects, although I have started a couple of
collections of images taken with my phone that could become something
eventually.

This year actually came with a change in equipment. I swapped out my Hasselblad
500C/M for a newer 501C, and with the change gained an 80mm CB lens, which which
all but one of the above images were taken. I did however stick with the trusty
Ilford HP5+ throughout, all shot at 400 except the last two which were at 800.
